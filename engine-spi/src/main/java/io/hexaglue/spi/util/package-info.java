/**
 * SPI utilities.
 *
 * <p>This package contains small, dependency-free helper utilities that are safe to expose
 * to plugin authors without pulling external libraries.</p>
 *
 * <p>These utilities are intentionally minimal. If a utility would significantly increase
 * the API surface area or become a de-facto "commons" library, it should remain in core or
 * in a separate optional module.</p>
